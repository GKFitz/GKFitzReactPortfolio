##Title 
Gillian K. Fitzgerald REACT Portfolio

## Description
This is the third iteration of my Columbia engineering Full-Stack Web Development program portfolio website. Unlike the last two, this portfolio has been written in React. It is also completely mobile responsive with an updated one page design. In the third section titled My Work, at least three examples of my group project and and completed homework assignment are displayed and linked to. The styling is mostly done in vanilla Html and Css, with the exception of the footer and icon bar which has been coded using Bootstrap. This website is deployed via GH pages.
